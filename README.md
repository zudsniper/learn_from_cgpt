## $Learning$ $from$ `ChatGPT`  
<sup> _by [@zod](https://gh.zod.tf)_ </sup>  
> The purpose of this analysis & audit of various different OpenAI ChatGPT generated code snippets is to attempt to draft a coherent, cohesive set of files which allows the reader to follow-along with my process using AI to correct AI-written code.   
  
### Preamble
This particular ChatGPT usage session began when @supercybermeh asked me to review their _entirely generated_ code -- the generator in this case being `ChatGPT3.5` May 24 Version.  
  
I pick up having simply placed his code into a gist file called `scraper.js` and creating the original file of this gist.  

### Usage Guide
There will be a `.yaml` file below this `README` which should essentially serve as your roadmap as to the entire process.

### In Closing
I hope you learned something. Because I just got mad at a robot.  
Over, and over, and over.
